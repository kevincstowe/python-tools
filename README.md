Basic tools for working with and around python

Tools added so far:<br>
  <h3>Main.py</h3>
    This is a skeleton of a python script - it includes a main method, crafted around the suggestions of Guido van Rossum here (http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=4829)<br>

  <h3>SDP.py</h3>
  Interface for Stanford Dependency Parser<br>

  <h3>FindSpace.py</h3>
  Tells how much space directories are holding - there's probably better built in ways<br>

  <h3>Validator.py</h3>
    Used for checking if an XML file is valid based on a schema. Doesn't work.<br>
